# Security Checklist for Git Deployment

Before pushing your project to GitHub, ensure the following security measures are in place:

## ✅ Environment Variables
- [x] `.env.local` is included in `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.template` is created with placeholder values
- [x] All sensitive API keys are in `.env.local` (not committed)
- [x] No hardcoded API keys or secrets in source code

## ✅ Sensitive Files
- [x] All environment files (`.env*`) are ignored
- [x] Virtual environments (`ml_env/`, `venv/`) are ignored
- [x] Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`) are ignored
- [x] ML model files (`*.h5`, `*.pkl`) are ignored (if sensitive)
- [x] Node.js dependencies (`node_modules/`) are ignored
- [x] Build outputs (`.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`) are ignored

## ✅ Configuration Files
- [x] No Firebase service account keys committed
- [x] No database credentials in source code
- [x] No private certificates or keys committed

## ✅ Documentation
- [x] README.md includes environment setup instructions
- [x] ML_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md provides setup documentation
- [x] Clear instructions for setting up API keys

## ✅ Git Status Check
Run `git status --ignored` to verify:
- All sensitive files appear under "Ignored files"
- No sensitive files appear under "Untracked files" or "Changes to be committed"

## Current Ignored Files (Good ✅)
- `.env.local` - Contains sensitive API keys
- `ml_predictor/ml_env/` - Python virtual environment
- `ml_predictor/__pycache__/` - Python cache files
- `ml_predictor/stock_model.h5` - ML model file
- `node_modules/` - Node.js dependencies
- `.next/` - Next.js build output

## Ready to Push ✅
Your project is now secure and ready for Git deployment. The sensitive information is properly protected.

## Post-Deployment Setup for Other Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.template` to `.env.local`
3. Fill in their own API keys in `.env.local`
4. Set up the Python ML environment using the provided setup scripts
5. Follow the ML_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md for complete setup

## Emergency: If Sensitive Data Was Accidentally Committed
If you accidentally commit sensitive data:
1. **Immediately** change all exposed API keys
2. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
3. Force push the cleaned repository
4. Regenerate all compromised credentials
